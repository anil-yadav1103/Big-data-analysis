Big Data Analysis Using PySpark and Dask
In todayâ€™s digital world, huge amounts of data are generated daily from various sources like social media, e-commerce, sensors, and healthcare systems. Processing such large datasets using traditional methods is slow and inefficient due to memory and computing limitations. To handle this challenge, Big Data tools like PySpark and Dask are used for efficient large-scale data analysis.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate Big Data analysis using PySpark and Dask. Both tools are designed for distributed computing and parallel processing, allowing them to handle data much larger than the memory of a single machine.

PySpark:
PySpark is the Python interface for Apache Spark, a widely-used distributed data processing engine. It is built for speed and efficiency using in-memory computations. PySpark allows users to:

Load large datasets from files like CSV or JSON
Perform data cleaning and transformations
Run SQL-like queries on distributed data
Aggregate and summarize large datasets
Generate insights from big datasets quickly
Dask:
Dask is a Python library designed for parallel computing. It extends pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to handle larger datasets without changing much of the coding style. Dask works well on both single machines and clusters. It is used in this task to:

Read large datasets in chunks
Perform parallel computations
Optimize memory usage with lazy evaluation
Visualize data and computation graphs
